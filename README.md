# NL2SparQL4NLU

This repository  developed by the Signals and Interactive Systems, University of Trento (Italy) contains data derived from NL2SparQL data set from Microsoft Research.

## Data Description
The data is split into training and tests sets following the original split of NL2SparQL dataset. 
Everything that contains 'train' is for training, 'test' for testing; otherwise, the formats are the same.
There are 4 files per split, differentiated by extensions.

Specifically, extensions and contents are the following:


- `*.conll.txt` 
	token-per-line CONLL format with tokens & NLU concept tags;
	automatically extracted from SPARQL queries & manually inspected.

- `*.features.conll.txt`
	POS-tag and Lemmas in token-per-line CONLL format (with tokens on the first column); 
	produced automatically using TreeTagger.

- `*.utterances.txt`
	utterance only; in utterance-per-line format.

- `*.utterance.labels.txt`
	labels per utterance for intent/utterance classification; automatically extracted from SPARQL queries.

The data has been modified from the original with respect to tokenization of possessive apostrophes.

E.G:
```
original: find the female actress from the movie she s the man
modified: find the female actress from the movie she 's the man
```

(+ some other fixes)
